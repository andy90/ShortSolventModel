vCaCl.nb calculates the effective solute-solute interaction between Ca2+ and Cl- in the short solvent model. It generates vCaCl_Ewald.txt which contains the correction to the solute-solute PMF after performing Ewald summation.

plot.py generates the plot for the ion-ion PMF in the Short solvent model and compares it with that in the full and Short Coulomb system.
