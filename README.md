# ShortSolventModel

This reporsitory contains code that are used to generate the potential-of-mean-force between solutes in full system, Gaussian-Truncated or ShortCoulomb system and the Short Solvent system. We use Ca2+ -- Cl- as the example. The implementation for other solutes can be obtained by simply changing the solute parameters.

CaCl-water contains code that calculate the Ca2+ -- Cl- pmf in the full system. It contains a readme.txt that tells you how to run the code.

CaCl-water_GT contains code that calculate the Ca2+ -- Cl- pmf in the Short Coulomb system. It contains a readme.txt that tells you how to run the code.

CaCl-water_ShortSolvent contains code that calculate the Ca2+ -- Cl- pmf in the Short Solvent system. It contains a readme.txt that tells you how to run the code.
